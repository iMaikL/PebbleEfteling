## Synopsis

A small Pebble Watchapp that makes your day in the Efteling even more fun. Check waitingtimes realtime on your wrist.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I love the Efteling and found out that I can use the data for projects. This project is also set up to learn more about writing JavaScript on a fun way. I think I'll learn JavaScript better when I do a project I really like and is created from bottom to top by myself. 

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Normally I would use the API from www.eftelstats.nl. Since the admin of that site said the API is unstable and so he's not sending out API keys I found out I can use the direct fetch from the Efteling servers. I only use this link for test purposes only and will not put the app on the Pebble Appstore with data pulled from this fetch. 

You can find the fetch here: http://www.nickd.nl/maik/efteling.php

## Tests

Tests for this application are mostly done with the build-in console in CloudPebble using console.log(); and also testing on the device itself.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
